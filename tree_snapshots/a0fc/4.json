            "reasoning": "ALB not showing 5xx spikes suggests that it is not the source of the 500s, making it unlikely that the problem resides at the load balancer or network layer. The presence of TimeoutErrors in the app logs, specifically under load, points to a backend bottleneck rather than random errors. Seeing DB connection saturation implicates exhaustion of the database connection pool during high concurrency, leading app workers to timeout and return 500 errors to clients.",

                    "reasoning": "Since the ALB metrics do not show 5xx spikes even when the app logs indicate 500 errors, it's likely these errors are being generated by the app internally and not making it to the ALB as full connections\u2014possibly due to backend timeouts. Intermittent 500s that appear under load alongside observed DB connection saturation point to an application-level shortage of available DB connections, which in turn causes request handlers to time out when trying to get a DB connection, resulting in 500 responses. This is a classic sign of DB connection pool exhaustion under high concurrency.",
