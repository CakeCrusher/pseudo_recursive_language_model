            "reasoning": "The intermittent 500 errors under load, together with TimeoutError in the logs, suggest that some requests are taking longer than expected and timing out. Database connection saturation further supports that the app may be exhausting available DB connections, leading to timeouts when new requests can't acquire one quickly enough. The missing 5xx spike in ALB metrics suggests that these 500s may not be seen at the ALB, possibly because client disconnects or FastAPI timeouts handle them before reaching ALB reporting thresholds, or retries mask the issue at load balancer level.",

                    "reasoning": "A minimal fix would likely involve increasing the database connection pool size or limiting the FastAPI app's concurrency to match the DB pool, thereby ensuring requests are queued instead of failing when the pool is exhausted. This would prevent the TimeoutErrors and the resulting 500s that happen when requests cannot acquire a connection. Monitoring both app-side timeouts and DB pool exhaustion after the fix would help confirm this hypothesis.",
