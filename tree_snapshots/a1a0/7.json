            "reasoning": "The intermittent 500 errors under load, together with TimeoutError in the logs, suggest that some requests are taking longer than expected and timing out. Database connection saturation further supports that the app may be exhausting available DB connections, leading to timeouts when new requests can't acquire one quickly enough. The missing 5xx spike in ALB metrics suggests that these 500s may not be seen at the ALB, possibly because client disconnects or FastAPI timeouts handle them before reaching ALB reporting thresholds, or retries mask the issue at load balancer level.",

                    "reasoning": "A minimal fix would likely involve increasing the database connection pool size or limiting the FastAPI app's concurrency to match the DB pool, thereby ensuring requests are queued instead of failing when the pool is exhausted. This would prevent the TimeoutErrors and the resulting 500s that happen when requests cannot acquire a connection. Monitoring both app-side timeouts and DB pool exhaustion after the fix would help confirm this hypothesis.",

Investigating DB performance and query timing during load tests would help determine if this is the limiting factor rather than pool size alone.",

FastAPI requests that cannot acquire a DB connection quickly enough may timeout and then return 500 errors to the client. The absence of a spike in 5xx metrics on ALB might be because the app-side 500 errors do not always propagate to the ALB, or because clients disconnect before completion, preventing 5xx metrics from being registered.",

The absence of 5xx spikes in ALB metrics could mean that these errors are being caught or handled by the app before they reach ALB, or clients may disconnect before the error is reported. To falsify this hypothesis, one would need evidence showing that DB connections remain available under load, or that 500s occur without connection saturation or timeouts in app logs.",
